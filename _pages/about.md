Hello! I'm an Assistant Professor at the [Bellini College of Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity and Computing](https://www.usf.edu/ai-cybersecurity-computing/) at the [University of South Florida (USF)](https://www.usf.edu). 

I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Michigan State University, where I worked in the [INSS lab](https://inss.egr.msu.edu), under the supervision of [Dr. Huacheng Zeng](https://inss.egr.msu.edu/team.html). Previously, I received my M.Eng. degree from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University.
