Hello! I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Michigan State University, working in the [INSS lab](https://inss.egr.msu.edu), under the supervision of [Dr. Huacheng Zeng](https://inss.egr.msu.edu/team.html). My research areas include wireless networking and sensing, mobile computing, and artificial intelligence.  

Previously, I reveived my B.Eng. degree from Beijing Univeristy of Technology and M.Eng. degree from Cornell University.

**Radio Sensing: Heartbeat and breathing rate detection using 6GHz FMCW radar**  
Ubiquitous sensing technologies enable smart home environments to monitor individuals' health status in their daily lives. In this project, we developed a 6 GHz FMCW radar system capable of measuring heartbeat and breathing rate in a contactless manner. Our system leverages the fact that radio signals are influenced by inhaling and exhaling motions, as well as the skin vibrations caused by heartbeats. The accompanying video demonstrates our system's ability to measure heartbeats and breathing rates in real time. The key features of our design include:

* Real-time measurement of heartbeat and breathing rate
* Integrated hardware and software design
* Dedicated signal processing pipeline

**Uplink MU-MIMO mmWave real-time Communication** \[IEEE Infocom 2023\]   
With the rapid proliferation of mobile devices, the marriage of millimeter-wave (mmWave) and MIMO technologies is a natural trend to meet the communication demand of data-hungry applications. Following this trend, mmWave multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) has been standardized by the IEEE 802.11ay for its downlink to achieve multi-Gbps data rate. Yet, its uplink counterpart has not been well studied, and its way to wireless local area networks (WLANs) remains unclear. In this project, we present a practical uplink MU-MIMO mmWave communication (UMMC) scheme for WLANs. UMMC has two key components: 

* An efficient Bayesian optimization (BayOpt) framework for joint beam search over multiple directional antennas
* A new MU-MIMO detector that can decode asynchronous data packets from multiple user devices
